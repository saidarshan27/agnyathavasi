This is a linear plot of the non linear screenplay of Agnyathavasi and plot breakdown for those who felt there was nothing in the plot and it was a very thin plot, with details which go unseen during the first watch.  

# 1. Early Childhood (Raghu and Family)

* Inspector (played by Rangayana Raghu, Inspector doesnt have a name hence Agnyathavasi, why agnyathavasi check the climax) and his family are from the same village where the story takes place.
* His mother, a struggling single woman, attempts suicide along with her two children.
* Srinivasaiah and young Inspector save them — but in that scene, young inspector bites of the mother's hand holding the child's, clearly pulls only the sibling, not the mother.
* There’s a strong suggestion that inspector sees his mother as a destructive force — not just to herself, but to the family’s future.
* In this scene Srinivasaiah, tells nobody has the right to take lives not even their own. 

# 2. 1972 – Marriage Proposal and the Breaking Point

* Inspector’s mother arranges his marriage and asks some rich guy from the same village for help in getting him posted as inspector in the village and getting him married to his daughter. 
* The condition? Inspector must stay at his wife’s house post-marriage, and their family will remain indebted to the wife’s family.
* This deeply hurts the mother. She again attempts suicide near the same well with the younger boy.
* Inspector had already planned to send his sister to the city for studies. But after this incident, the sister decides to stay with the mother, fearing if she does persue what her brother decided for her, they might be drowned once again in their mother's anger.
* Inspector, believing his mother is a threat to the family’s progress, kills her using a root poison called **Pashambara** by serving it in *payasa*.

# 3. 25 Years Later – Rohit and the Modern Day

* Rohit, a young man, brings in a computer to become a “digital” postman in the village.
* He receives and sends emails on behalf of villagers.
* He finds himself caught between **Pankaja** and **Arun** (Srinivasaiah’s son in the US), who were once lovers.
* Srinivasaiah disapproves of the computer and expresses a view that *children must be left to themselves*. Inspector echoes the same sentiment in a scene with a guilty face, hinting at his own past.
* Srinivasaiah also mentions he wants to donate all his wealth to orphans.
* Rohit gets greedy — he wants to start a company with Arun, and if the wealth is donated, that dream collapses.
* Meanwhile, he also begins to get emotionally (and perhaps romantically) entangled with Pankaja.

# 4. Inspector's 25-Year Remembrance Ritual

* Inspector prepares the same **payasa** dish he once used to poison his mother — this time for her *shraddha* (without the poison obviously xD).
* While serving it to his daughter, she compliments it, and Inspector’s face shows visible guilt. He zones out momentarily, haunted by memory.

# 5. Pankaja's Turn

* Pankaja sends her mother out on work. We see water laced with **Pashambara** in the next scene.
* She visits Rohit for emails from Arun. He asks her why she’s not married. She says:*“The mind doesn’t differentiate between good and bad — it wants what it wants.”*This tells us she is prepared to go to **any length** to get Arun back.
* While the internet loads, Rohit tries to touch her hand. She gets angry, but he smooths it over, telling her not to get angry, calling her Panku (suggesting they are getting closer), as if that phrase was in the email.
* Pankaja tells him to come home in the evening — she’s preparing chicken for Srinivasaiah — and she leaves, she thows the sampige flower to the ground which she was wearing, what is the significance of the sampige flower stay tuned. 
* Pankaja rages out in anger and goes home kills the chicken violently and her hand is shown full of blood, symbolizing she got her hand dirty right there and fall down has started. 
* Krishna in Bhagavat Geeta sums it up pretty well, telling attachment leads to desire, not fulfulling the desire leads to anger, anger leads to desolution, loosing vivekathana, they will do whatever for fulfilling their desire, from there they are doomed completely. Summarizes Pankaja's actions pretty well. 
* She prepares the chicken laced with Pashambara poison infested water. 

# 6. The Kiss – Was it a Death Kiss?

* Pankaja hands over the chicken to Rohit and gives him a kiss, despite having been angry just moments ago.
* Was it a final kiss, suggesting she is going to kill Rohit also ?, because the scene doesn't make sense at all, in the previous scene she was angry and shocked when Rohit touched her. Why would she kiss and tell to leave this incident here ? Does it suggest she was also unknowingly getting closer to Rohit and then again realized her love for Arun?. 
* She says, *“Some relationships don’t go far — let’s leave this incident here.”*
* She also remindes him explictly "Not to taste the chicken". 
* This kiss shocks Rohit. Then, while returning, he picks up a **sampige flower** — a tree linked to her and Arun’s love — and suddenly looks happy.
* The kiss could be seen as **calculated**:
   * It might have been a final emotional bait.
   * She may have predicted that Rohit, emotionally confused, might eat the chicken out of longing — effectively **making him a second victim**.

# 7. Rohit’s Moral Collapse

* On the way back, Rohit meets someone carrying Srinivasaiah’s will — realizing that the donation might happen soon.
* He rushes home and decides to lace the chicken with **his own poisons**, unaware it’s already poisoned by Pankaja.

# 8. Srinivasaiah's Death

* Rohit gives the plated chicken to Srinivasaiah, who asks him to eat too. Rohit lies, saying it’s Monday.
* Srinivasaiah starts to choke. Rohit watches, doesn’t help.
* Once he dies, Rohit removes evidence, disposes of the chicken, washes the plate, and arranges the scene to look natural.

# 9. Rohit’s Own Death

* Back home, Rohit eats the chicken. Was this the plan of Pankaja to take out Rohit because he made an advance towards her ?. 
* Just then, **a mother elephant sacrifices herself to save her baby** from an electric fence.
* The village’s power goes out. The PC catches fire.🐘 
* Comparison: Inspector’s Mother vs The Elephant Mother
   * The elephant **sacrifices herself** to protect her child — a symbol of dharma.
   * Inspector’s mother, by contrast, **tries to take her children’s lives** — twice.
   * This visual metaphor sets up Inspector’s **guilt** and emotional conflict.

# 10. Inspector Investigates

* Inspector rushes to Srinivasaiah’s house in the morning right after the day of rememberance.
* He notices small clues (food on lip, wet plate, discarded chicken).
* An **animal’s reaction** to the discarded chicken confirms the presence of Pashambara — only animals detect it.
* He declares it a **murder**.
* Here when Ananthu argues that murder is not possible in this village there hasn't been a petty theft from 25years, Inspector tells Ananthu there is no lethal weapon than the intellect, slightly hinting, we may also look it as bragging of his past. 

# 11. Pankaja Under Suspicion

* Pankaja arrives wearing **sampige flowers**, hoping to meet Arun.
* She respects Srinivasaiah's body with a Mala of Sampige flowers, may be indicating, the sacrifice of Srinivasiah might led her to Arun, it almost seems like she is thanking Srinivasaiah by offering a mala of flowers linked to thier personal love story. 
* Her quick suggestion that Rohit might know Arun’s address raises suspicion.
* Later, Rohit is found **dead**. Family assumes it’s from the PC fire, but Inspector sees the chicken and knows.

# 12. Pankaja Interrogated

* Inspector brings her in. Evidence is found — Pashambara root and pot of poison near her house.
* She confesses: she poisoned Srinivasaiah to be with Arun.
* Inspector explains how Pashambara works — but acts strange and nervous during the explanation.
* Ananthu notices this.
* Ananthu  right after this talks about forgiveness, recites a sholka from Ramayana, which talks about forgiveness, tells forgiveness is dharma, forgiveness is sathya and the loka thrives on forgiveness. 
* But right after calls Pankaja Vishakanye and accusses her for killing both Srinivasaiah and Rohit. 
* So did Ananthu come to a conclusion that Rohit was also killed by Pankaja knowingly?. 

# 13. Ananthu Connects the Dots

* He recalls Inspector mother’s sudden death.
* While dropping Inspector home, Ananthu confronts him.
* Raghu steps inside his gate and **closes it himself** — symbolizing a **self-imposed prison**.

He says:

> When the villages know of Pankaja's crime, she looses 90% of her baggage(guilt), but I am carrying it for 25 years without uttering a word to anyone, hence 'Agnyathavasi'

# 14. Final Scene – Redemption Attempt

* Cut to the remembrance day.
* Inspector offers food to a **crow**, cries for forgiveness from his mother.
* In Hindu belief, ancestors live through time and receive *shraddha* offerings as crows.
* Inspector cries and says: *“There was no other option. I did it for the good of my siblings.”*
* *"They all left me, I am suffering for the horrendous act, I have become a "onti pishachi"".*

# 15. Conclusion
  The writer gives us a rich subtext, suggesting that the core theme of the story is the human mind and its craving—both for intellectual superiority and sensory pleasures. At its heart, the film explores a profound question: What made Rama touch Ahalya's feet? It becomes a meditation on forgiveness, inviting the audience to ask themselves the same—Should we forgive Raghu’s character, the inspector?
  All the main characters in the story symbolically represent the Arishadvarga—Kama (lust), Krodha (anger), Moha (delusion), Lobha (greed), Mada (pride), and Matsarya (jealousy). These six are considered the internal enemies of the human being in Indian philosophy. Most human actions are driven by one or more of these, and the spiritual path is said to involve overcoming them.
  The story is a fully human tale, portraying how succumbing to these inner enemies inevitably leads to one’s downfall. No character walks away unpunished:
  Rohit dies without ever realizing that the chicken was poisoned.
  Pankaja is likely to face imprisonment or even the gallows.
  The inspector is weighed down by the guilt of having killed his own mother.
  He has also lost contact with his siblings, for reasons not fully revealed, adding to his suffering.
  Each of these consequences reflects the inescapable law of Karma. The film doesn’t just narrate a crime—it reflects on why people commit wrongs, how the mind justifies them, and how nature or destiny ensures that no action goes unpaid.
    
  The film ultimately leaves us with a question.
  
  There are **two murders** in the narrative—
  
  1. **Pankaja’s murder of Srinivasaiah**
  2. **Inspector’s murder of his own mother**
  
  Pankaja’s act is driven by **Kāma** and **Moha**—her attachment and obsession with Arun. Rohit, too, poisons the chicken out of **Lobha** and **Mātsarya**—jealousy and greed. But Rohit is punished immediately; he suffers for it then and there.
  
  Pankaja, by the end, may be sentenced—to jail or the gallows.  
  But **Inspector** has been silently suffering for **25 years**, never having revealed that it was he who killed his own mother.
  
  So the film poses a deep question:
  
  **Is Inspector punished or not?**
  
  Can we call any act by itself Dharma or Adharma in isolation?  
  The answer lies in *context*. There’s a story from the **Mahabharata**—a sage who had vowed never to lie, sees people hiding from thieves in the bushes. The thieves ask him where they went. Bound by his vow, the sage tells the truth. The people are found and killed.  
  When the sage dies, he is sent to **hell**, and the reason given is that his *truthfulness led to Adharma*—despite it being a 'virtuous' act in isolation.
  
  This is the same argument that surrounds the entire **battle of Kurukshetra**.  
  Krishna plans and orchestrates the death of every key player using deceit. Even the Pandavas commit acts of Adharma **to establish Dharma**. But that doesn’t mean they go unpunished—*they, too, suffer in hell after death for their actions*.
  
  So, in my view, the film does not spoon-feed a message.  
  It presents a sequence of events.  
  And in doing so, it **asks us**: *What is Dharma? What is Adharma? Who truly suffers? And who is punished?Who should be forgiven?*
