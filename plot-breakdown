This is a linear plot of the non linear screenplay of Agnyathavasi and plot breakdown for those who felt there was nothing in the plot and it was a very thin plot, with details which go unseen during the first watch.  

# 1. Early Childhood (Raghu and Family)

* Inspector Govindu (played by Rangayana Raghu) and his family are from the same village where the story takes place.
* His mother, a struggling single woman, attempts suicide along with her two children.
* Srinivasaiah and young Govindu save them — but in that scene, Govindu clearly pulls only the sibling, not the mother.
* There’s a strong suggestion that Raghu sees his mother as a destructive force — not just to herself, but to the family’s future.
* In this scene Srinivasaiah, tells nobody has the right to take lives not even their own. 

# 2. 1972 – Marriage Proposal and the Breaking Point

* Govindu’s mother arranges his marriage and asks some rich guy from the same village for help in getting him posted as inspector in the village and getting him married to his daughter. 
* The condition? Govindu must stay at his wife’s house post-marriage, and their family will remain indebted to the wife’s family.
* This deeply hurts the mother. She again attempts suicide near the same pond with the younger boy.
* Govindu had already planned to send his sister to the city for studies. But after this incident, the sister decides to stay with the mother, fearing her instability.
* Raghu, believing his mother is a threat to the family’s progress, kills her using a root poison called **Pashambara** by serving it in *payasa*.

# 3. 25 Years Later – Rohit and the Modern Day

* Rohit, a young man, brings in a computer to become a “digital” postman in the village.
* He receives and sends emails on behalf of villagers.
* He finds himself caught between **Pankaja** and **Arun** (Srinivasaiah’s son in the US), who were once lovers.
* Srinivasaiah disapproves of the computer and expresses a view that *children must be left to themselves*. Govindu echoes the same sentiment in a scene, hinting at his own past.
* Srinivasaiah also mentions he wants to donate all his wealth to orphans.
* Rohit gets greedy — he wants to start a company with Arun, and if the wealth is donated, that dream collapses.
* Meanwhile, he also begins to get emotionally (and perhaps romantically) entangled with Pankaja.

# 4. Raghu's 25-Year Remembrance Ritual

* Govindu prepares the same **payasa** dish he once used to poison his mother — this time for her *shraddha*.
* While serving it to his daughter, she compliments it, and Govindu’s face shows visible guilt. He zones out momentarily, haunted by memory.

# 5. Pankaja's Turn

* Pankaja sends her mother out on work. We see water laced with **Pashambara** in the next scene.
* She visits Rohit for emails from Arun. He asks her why she’s not married. She says:*“The mind doesn’t differentiate between good and bad — it wants what it wants.”*This tells us she is prepared to go to **any length** to get Arun back.
* While the internet loads, Rohit tries to touch her hand. She gets angry, but he smooths it over, telling her not to get angry, as if that phrase was in the email.
* Pankaja tells him to come home in the evening — she’s preparing chicken for Srinivasaiah — and she leaves, she thows the sampige flower to the ground which she was wearing, what is the significance of the sampige flower stay tuned. 
* Pankaja rages out in anger and goes home kills the chicken violently and her hand is shown full of blood, symbolizing she got her hand dirty right there and fall down has started. 
* Krishna in Bhagavat Geeta sums it up pretty well, telling attachment leads to desire, not fulfulling the desire leads to anger, anger leads to desolution, loosing vivekathana, they will do whatever for fulfilling their desire, from there they are doomed completely. Summarizes Pankaja's actions pretty well. 
* She prepares the chicken laced with Pashambara poison infested water. 

# 6. The Kiss – Was it a Death Kiss?

* Pankaja hands over the chicken to Rohit and gives him a kiss, despite having been angry just moments ago.
* She says, *“Some relationships don’t go far — let’s leave this incident here.”*
* This kiss shocks Rohit. Then, while returning, he picks up a **sampige flower** — a tree linked to her and Arun’s love — and suddenly looks happy.
* The kiss could be seen as **calculated**:
   * It might have been a final emotional bait.
   * She may have predicted that Rohit, emotionally confused, might eat the chicken out of longing — effectively **making him a second victim**.

# 7. Rohit’s Moral Collapse

* On the way back, Rohit meets someone carrying Srinivasaiah’s will — realizing that the donation might happen soon.
* He rushes home and decides to lace the chicken with **his own poisons**, unaware it’s already poisoned by Pankaja.

# 8. Srinivasaiah's Death

* Rohit gives the plated chicken to Srinivasaiah, who asks him to eat too. Rohit lies, saying it’s Monday.
* Srinivasaiah starts to choke. Rohit watches, doesn’t help.
* Once he dies, Rohit removes evidence, disposes of the chicken, washes the plate, and arranges the scene to look natural.

# 9. Rohit’s Own Death

* Back home, Rohit eats the chicken. Was this the plan of Pankaja to take out Rohit because he made an advance towards her ?. 
* Just then, **a mother elephant sacrifices herself to save her baby** from an electric fence.
* The village’s power goes out. The PC catches fire.🐘 
* Comparison: Govindu’s Mother vs The Elephant Mother
   * The elephant **sacrifices herself** to protect her child — a symbol of dharma.
   * Govindu’s mother, by contrast, **tries to take her children’s lives** — twice.
   * This visual metaphor sets up Govindu’s **guilt** and emotional conflict.

# 10. Inspector Govindu Investigates

* Govindu rushes to Srinivasaiah’s house in the morning right after the day of rememberance.
* He notices small clues (food on lip, wet plate, discarded chicken).
* An **animal’s reaction** to the discarded chicken confirms the presence of Pashambara — only animals detect it.
* He declares it a **murder**.
* Here when Ananthu argues that murder is not possible in this village there hasn't been a petty theft from 25years, Govindu tells Ananthu there is no lethal weapon than the intellect, slightly hinting at his past. 

# 11. Pankaja Under Suspicion

* Pankaja arrives wearing **sampige flowers**, hoping to meet Arun.
* Her quick suggestion that Rohit might know Arun’s address raises suspicion.
* Later, Rohit is found **dead**. Family assumes it’s from the PC fire, but Govindu sees the chicken and knows.

# 12. Pankaja Interrogated

* Inspector Govindu brings her in. Evidence is found — Pashambara root and pot of poison near her house.
* She confesses: she poisoned Srinivasaiah to be with Arun.
* Inspector Govindu explains how Pashambara works — but acts strange and nervous during the explanation.
* Ananthu notices this.
* Ananthu  right after this talks about forgiveness, recites a sholka from Ramayana, which talks about forgiveness, tells forgiveness is dharma, forgiveness is sathya and the loka thrives on forgiveness. 
* But right after calls Pankaja Vishakanye and accusses her for killing both Srinivasaiah and Rohit. 
* So did Ananthu come to a conclusion that Rohit was also killed by Pankaja knowingly?. 

# 13. Ananthu Connects the Dots

* He recalls Raghu’s mother’s sudden death.
* While dropping Raghu home, Ananthu confronts him.
* Raghu steps inside his gate and **closes it himself** — symbolizing a **self-imposed prison**.

He says:

>

# 14. Final Scene – Redemption Attempt

* Cut to the remembrance day.
* Govindu offers food to a **crow**, cries for forgiveness from his mother.
* In Hindu belief, ancestors live through time and receive *shraddha* offerings as crows.
* Govindu cries and says: *“There was no other option. I did it for the good of my siblings.”*
* *"They all left me, I am suffering for the act I did towards you, I have become a "onti pishachi"".*

  
The film ultimately leaves us with a question.

There are **two murders** in the narrative—

1. **Pankaja’s murder of Srinivasaiah**
2. **Inspector Govindu’s murder of his own mother**

Pankaja’s act is driven by **Kāma** and **Moha**—her attachment and obsession with Arun. Rohit, too, poisons the chicken out of **Lobha** and **Mātsarya**—jealousy and greed. But Rohit is punished immediately; he suffers for it then and there.

Pankaja, by the end, may be sentenced—to jail or the gallows.  
But **Inspector Govindu** has been silently suffering for **25 years**, never having revealed that it was he who killed his own mother.

So the film poses a deep question:

**Is Govindu punished or not?**

Can we call any act by itself Dharma or Adharma in isolation?  
The answer lies in *context*. There’s a story from the **Mahabharata**—a sage who had vowed never to lie, sees people hiding from thieves in the bushes. The thieves ask him where they went. Bound by his vow, the sage tells the truth. The people are found and killed.  
When the sage dies, he is sent to **hell**, and the reason given is that his *truthfulness led to Adharma*—despite it being a 'virtuous' act in isolation.

This is the same argument that surrounds the entire **battle of Kurukshetra**.  
Krishna plans and orchestrates the death of every key player using deceit. Even the Pandavas commit acts of Adharma **to establish Dharma**. But that doesn’t mean they go unpunished—*they, too, suffer in hell after death for their actions*.

So, in my view, the film does not spoon-feed a message.  
It presents a sequence of events.  
And in doing so, it **asks us**: *What is Dharma? What is Adharma? Who truly suffers? And who is punished?*
